## 🛠️ Key Projects

- **🔐 Secure Embedded Sensing System**  
  Real-time multi-node sensor network using Raspberry Pi & MQTT with TLS; built low-level C drivers and integrated TinyML for anomaly detection.

- **🔋 Battery Management System (ESP32)**  
  Developed firmware to monitor voltage, current, and temperature over I2C/SPI/UART; enabled real-time SoC/TTE prediction via MQTT.

- **🧠 Reservoir Computing on Edge Devices**  
  Designed efficient time-series prediction pipelines with AdderNet-enhanced models for wearable embedded AI platforms.

- **🤖 Bare-Metal on RP2040 (Pico2)**  
  Wrote drivers for UART, SPI, I2C, and ADC; performed low-level debugging using logic analyzers and explored bootloader behavior.

- **🛡️ Network Intrusion Detection System**  
  Built a lightweight Python pipeline and trained a RandomForest model for real-time threat detection on network traffic.
