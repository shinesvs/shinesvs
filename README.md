# 👋 Hi, I'm Shine Vattuparampil Sam

🎓 Graduate student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Binghamton University  
⚡ Passionate about Embedded Systems, Firmware, and Edge AI  

🔎 I'm always exploring **new technologies**, whether it's RISC-V-based hardware or edge ML models.  
    I love working in cross-functional environments where software meets hardware.

##  Highlighted Projects

- **Secure Embedded Sensing System**  
  Developed a multi-node sensor network using Raspberry Pi and MQTT with TLS encryption; integrated TinyML for edge anomaly detection.

- **Battery Management System (ESP32)**  
  Built C/C++ firmware for real-time voltage/current monitoring via I2C/SPI/UART; published diagnostics over MQTT with <5% error.

- **Bare-Metal Driver Development on RP2040**  
  Explored bare-metal features of the RP2040 microcontroller, testing UART, SPI, I2C, PWM, and ADC through register-level programming.

- **Reservoir Computing for Edge AI**  
  Integrated AdderNet into a ReservoirPy-based time-series prediction model, enabling ~35% reduction in compute load and improving efficiency for edge AI applications.
